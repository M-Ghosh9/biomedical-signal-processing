Signal processing and measurement: which involves pre-processing, detecting points of interest and taking measurements on the electrocardiogram.
Interpretation: who would be responsible for looking for clinical significance in the measurements obtained in the first step.
The focus of this work will be the signal processing and measurement step, for which some of the methods described in the literature will be implemented in Python and tested on real ECG signals.II - Signal Pre-processing and Conditioning
Electrocardiogram abnormalities that do not result from the electrical activity of the heart are defined as artifacts. Artifacts are not uncommon in patients undergoing ECG monitoring. They alter the morphology of the ECG and can lead to diagnostic errors, both false positives, mimicking arrhythmias, and false negatives, hiding findings consistent with heart disease.

Among the main artifacts present, the following stand out: Electric grid interference; Low frequency fluctuations (Baseline Wander); High frequency noise and muscle noise.
